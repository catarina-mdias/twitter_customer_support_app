# Evaluation & Quality Assurance Framework
_Generated: 2025-10-17_

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the evaluation metrics and quality assessment framework for the Twitter Customer Support Analytics App. The framework focuses on **efficiency metrics** that demonstrate practical value by making tasks faster, simpler, or clearer compared to manual analysis. The approach emphasizes **impact over accuracy** and provides meaningful efficiency metrics with reasoned improvement estimates.

## Core Efficiency Metrics

### 1. **Analysis Time Reduction (ATR)**
**What it measures**: Time saved in generating customer support insights compared to manual analysis.

**How to measure**:
- **Baseline**: Manual analysis of 1,000 support interactions takes ~4-6 hours for a data analyst
- **With App**: Same analysis completed in ~15-30 minutes using automated processing
- **Calculation**: `ATR = (Manual Time - App Time) / Manual Time × 100%`
- **Target Improvement**: **85-90% time reduction**

**Reasoning**: The app automates data processing, response time calculations, sentiment analysis, and visualization generation that would otherwise require:
- Manual CSV parsing and cleaning
- Custom script development for calculations
- Chart creation in Excel/Tableau
- Sentiment analysis using external tools
- Report compilation and formatting

### 2. **Insight Discovery Speed (IDS)**
**What it measures**: Speed of identifying actionable insights from support data.

**How to measure**:
- **Baseline**: Manual analysis requires 2-3 days to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
- **With App**: Real-time dashboard provides immediate insights and automated alerts
- **Calculation**: `IDS = (Manual Discovery Time - App Discovery Time) / Manual Discovery Time × 100%`
- **Target Improvement**: **95% faster insight discovery**

**Reasoning**: The app provides:
- Real-time KPI monitoring (p50/p90 response times)
- Automated anomaly detection
- Instant peer benchmarking
- Proactive alerting for performance degradation
- Interactive visualizations for pattern recognition

### 3. **Decision-Making Clarity (DMC)**
**What it measures**: Improvement in decision-making quality through better data presentation and actionable recommendations.

**How to measure**:
- **Baseline**: Manual reports provide basic statistics without context or recommendations
- **With App**: Provides contextualized insights, peer comparisons, and specific recommendations
- **Calculation**: Qualitative assessment through stakeholder feedback and decision implementation rates
- **Target Improvement**: **70% improvement in decision confidence and implementation rate**

**Reasoning**: The app enhances decision-making by:
- Providing percentile-based KPIs (p50/p90) instead of misleading averages
- Offering peer benchmarking for context
- Generating specific, actionable recommendations
- Visualizing trends and patterns clearly
- Enabling scenario analysis and forecasting

## Quality Assessment Framework

### Data Quality Metrics

#### **Pair Validity Rate**
- **Target**: ≥95% of response pairs correctly classified
- **Measurement**: Percentage of pairs with `pair_status=valid`
- **Impact**: Ensures reliable latency calculations and prevents skewed metrics

#### **KPI Freshness**
- **Target**: ≤4 hours data latency
- **Measurement**: Age of latest metric calculation
- **Impact**: Enables real-time decision making and early warning systems

#### **Data Completeness**
- **Target**: ≥90% complete records for core fields
- **Measurement**: Percentage of non-null values in critical columns
- **Impact**: Ensures comprehensive analysis coverage

### Performance Quality Metrics

#### **Response Time Accuracy**
- **Target**: ±5% accuracy in latency calculations
- **Measurement**: Comparison with manual verification samples
- **Impact**: Ensures trustworthy operational metrics

#### **Sentiment Analysis Reliability**
- **Target**: ≥80% agreement with human annotation
- **Measurement**: F1-score against manually labeled sentiment samples
- **Impact**: Enables reliable customer satisfaction insights

#### **Visualization Clarity**
- **Target**: ≥90% user comprehension rate
- **Measurement**: User testing with stakeholder feedback
- **Impact**: Ensures effective communication of insights

## Baseline Performance (From Impact Analysis)

Based on the impact_context artifacts, the current baseline performance shows:

### **Response Time Distribution**
- **Mean**: 17,180.8 seconds (4.8 hours)
- **Median (p50)**: 1,140.5 seconds (19 minutes)
- **p90**: 30,222.2 seconds (8.4 hours)

### **Data Quality Challenges**
- **Thread linkage sparsity**: ~26% missing parent tweet links
- **Response tweet sparsity**: ~33% missing response links
- **Outlier impact**: Extreme latencies (10M+ seconds) skew averages

### **Brand Performance Variation**
- **Fast responders**: Brands with response times under 1,000 seconds
- **Moderate performers**: Brands with response times between 1,000-5,000 seconds
- **Slow responders**: Brands with response times between 5,000-15,000 seconds
- **Extreme outliers**: Brands with response times exceeding 50,000 seconds

## Success Criteria

### **Phase 1 Success (MVP)**
- **ATR**: ≥80% time reduction in analysis tasks
- **IDS**: ≥90% faster insight discovery
- **DMC**: ≥60% improvement in decision confidence
