# Reports Sentiment Analysis Fix Summary

## Issue
The Sentiment Analysis section was not appearing in generated PDF reports even when the section was selected in the filters.

---

## Root Cause

The sentiment section had a strict requirement check:
```python
if include_sentiment and 'combined_score' in df.columns:
```

**Problems:**
1. Only looked for `combined_score` column
2. Didn't handle cases where sentiment columns have different names
3. Didn't show anything if the specific column wasn't found
4. No fallback or error message

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Multiple Column Name Support
Now checks for alternative sentiment column names:
- `combined_score` (preferred)
- `vader_compound` (VADER sentiment)
- `textblob_polarity` (TextBlob sentiment)

### 2. Always Show Section When Selected
The section header and content always appear when checked, even if data isn't available.

### 3. Smart Label Detection
Uses appropriate labels based on which column is found:
- "Combined Sentiment Score"
- "VADER Sentiment Score"
- "TextBlob Sentiment Score"

### 4. Fallback Distribution Calculation
If no `category` column exists, calculates distribution from score ranges:
- Positive: score > 0.05
- Negative: score < -0.05
- Neutral: -0.05 to 0.05

### 5. Informative Messages
Shows helpful messages when data isn't available:
- "No sentiment data available for the selected teams"
- "Sentiment analysis data is not available in this dataset"

## Implementation

### File: `src/app.py` (Lines 226-287)

#### Before:
```python
if include_sentiment and 'combined_score' in df.columns:
    # Generate sentiment section
    # Only works if 'combined_score' exists
```

#### After:
```python
if include_sentiment:
    # Check for multiple possible column names
    has_sentiment = (
        'combined_score' in df.columns or 
        'vader_compound' in df.columns or 
        'textblob_polarity' in df.columns
    )
    
    if has_sentiment:
        # Determine which column to use
        if 'combined_score' in df.columns:
            sentiment_data = df['combined_score'].dropna()
            score_label = "Combined Sentiment Score"
        elif 'vader_compound' in df.columns:
            sentiment_data = df['vader_compound'].dropna()
            score_label = "VADER Sentiment Score"
        else:
            sentiment_data = df['textblob_polarity'].dropna()
            score_label = "TextBlob Sentiment Score"
        
        # Generate statistics with appropriate labels
        # ...
        
        # Handle distribution with or without category column
        if 'category' in df.columns:
            # Use existing categories
        else:
            # Calculate from score ranges
            positive = (sentiment_data > 0.05).sum()
            negative = (sentiment_data < -0.05).sum()
            neutral = len(sentiment_data) - positive - negative
    else:
        # Show message that data isn't available
```

## New Features

### 1. Flexible Column Detection
âœ… Works with `combined_score`  
âœ… Works with `vader_compound`  
âœ… Works with `textblob_polarity`  
âœ… Can be extended to support more columns

### 2. Automatic Distribution Calculation
âœ… Uses `category` column if available  
âœ… Calculates from scores if no category  
âœ… Consistent threshold: Â±0.05

### 3. Better User Experience
âœ… Section always appears when checked  
âœ… Clear messages when data unavailable  
âœ… Appropriate labels for different score types  
âœ… Handles empty data gracefully

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Data (combined_score + category)
**Data:** Has `combined_score` and `category` columns  
**Result:** âœ… Full sentiment section with statistics and category distribution

### Scenario 2: VADER Only (vader_compound, no category)
**Data:** Has `vader_compound` but no `category` column  
**Result:** âœ… Sentiment section with VADER scores and calculated distribution

### Scenario 3: No Sentiment Data
**Data:** No sentiment columns at all  
**Result:** âœ… Section shows with message "Sentiment analysis data is not available"

### Scenario 4: Team Filtering Removes All Sentiment Data
**Data:** Has sentiment columns but filtered teams have no sentiment data  
**Result:** âœ… Section shows with message "No sentiment data available for the selected teams"

## Benefits

1. **Robustness**: Works with different sentiment analysis implementations
2. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple column naming conventions
3. **User-Friendly**: Always shows something, never silently fails
4. **Smart**: Calculates distributions when categories aren't available
5. **Informative**: Clear messages explain why data isn't shown
6. **Maintainable**: Easy to add support for more column types

## Code Quality

âœ… **No Linting Errors**: Code passes all linting checks  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks prevent crashes  
âœ… **Defensive Programming**: Checks for data existence before using  
âœ… **Clear Logic**: Well-commented and easy to understand  
âœ… **DRY Principle**: Reusable pattern for checking columns

## Documentation Updates

Updated the following documentation files to reflect the simplified reporting system:

### 1. `docs/scope.md`
- âœ… Updated Phase 4 description to reflect removal of predictive analytics
- âœ… Updated completion percentage (100% â†’ 90%)
- âœ… Updated key features description
- âœ… Updated reporting description to "Comprehensive PDF Reporting"

### 2. `docs/phase_4_implementation.md`
- âœ… Added note about simplification at the top

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If needed, could add:
1. Support for more sentiment column types
2. Custom threshold configuration (instead of hardcoded Â±0.05)
3. Sentiment trend analysis (if timestamp data available)
4. More detailed sentiment breakdowns (very positive, slightly positive, etc.)
5. Sentiment by team comparison table
