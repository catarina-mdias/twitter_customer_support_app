## Executive Summary
Organizations running social support channels struggle to maintain **low first‑reply latency** under variable workload and case complexity. A **benchmark + telemetry** product that normalizes data (thread‑safe pairing), tracks **p50/p90 latency**, and provides **actionable alerts** addresses a clear gap between raw social data and operational decisioning.

## Market Opportunity & Sizing (indicative)
- **Who**: Mid‑to‑large brands with active Twitter/X support (retail, travel, telecom, streaming).
- **Why now**: Public visibility of delays, cost pressure on headcount, and the maturity of AI triage/assist tooling.
- **Sizing (top‑down)**: If ~20k global brands run social support and 15% are “active”, and 10% would pay €6–15k/year, TAM ≈ **€18–45M** for the benchmark/telemetry niche (ex‑services).

## Competitive Landscape
- **Native Platform Analytics**: Basic averages; limited pairing logic and cross‑brand benchmarking.
- **Social Listening Suites** (e.g., Sprout, Brandwatch): Strong sentiment/mentions, weaker SLA pairing and latency science.
- **BPO/Workforce Tools**: Staffing models but lack neutral, public‑data benchmarking.
**Differentiator**: **Thread‑safe latency science**, open KPIs (p50/p90/MTTA), **brand‑level benchmark**, and **playbook‑grade alerts**.

## Stakeholders & Personas
- **Support Operations Manager**: Owns SLAs, schedules agents; needs intraday early‑warning.
- **Head of CX**: Needs brand‑level positioning vs peers; budget holder for improvements.
- **Product Owner (Automation)**: Needs topic and triage insights to target automation.

## Value Proposition Canvas (abridged)
- **Jobs‑to‑be‑done**: Keep public response fast; triage intelligently; prove improvement.
- **Pains**: Noisy data, unclear baselines, firefighting.
- **Gains**: Trustworthy KPIs, peer benchmark, clear triggers to act.
- **Enablers**: Our pairing logic, winsorization, NLP enrichment, live telemetry.

## Business Model
- **SaaS** with 2 tiers:
  - **Benchmark** (€5–8k/yr): brand KPI reports, monthly insights.
  - **Telemetry Pro** (€12–18k/yr): live alerts, intraday dashboards, API export.
- **Services** (optional): onboarding, data quality remediation, playbook design.
